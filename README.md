# Project 3 from CS210: Programming Languages SNHU


Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  - In this project, we were prompted by a grocery store to keep track of the inventory of certain produce items from the store's beginning to the closing of the         store. The user maybe the manager could use this application to check the stock at the end of the night, or if associates wanted to find stock during the day.

  
What did you do particularly well?
  - I feel that my input validation I did particularly well even though it was not a requirement I still put my best effort into making the program not crash I          even designed a unit test, so I didn't have to manually test every extreme.


Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  - Definitely, the output formatting as that was why my grade was deducted because my output was sloppy which would improve the user experience as it elevates the     user's perception if the output is well-executed.
    
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  - The part I had the most difficulty in this project was the input validation and utilizing catch and try blocks. I utilized the C++ documentation to help me         overcome this hurdle as some concepts were not heavily explored in the ZyBooks readings.

    
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?
  - Utilizing the data structure of a map or a dictionary which can be a collection of objects which is very useful for algorithms or sorting objects together to       perform certain tasks. My methods of input validation can also be transferable as I used Project 2 to help me with my input validation instead of writing it        from scratch.
    
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  - By Making the program modular and having different files to separate the driver file, function declaration, and definitions made my main readable as there          isn't much there that makes it overly complex since it is abstracted from the user. Since there are different files it is more simple to find bugs when the         code is not producing the right output. As I said before the methods from the class can also be utilized in other programs to make it more efficient for the        programmer to focus more on the complex parts of a future application.
